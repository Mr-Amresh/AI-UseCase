Detailed Feedback:

Problem:
Score: 7/10
**Strengths**: Clearly identifies the issue of low AI adoption in enterprises. Provides statistics (85% failure rate) to support the claim. Highlights key challenges: high costs, complex deployment, inefficient workflows.  Recognizes the urgency by mentioning the risk of falling behind competitors.
