**Weaknesses**: While the section mentions 'manual bookkeeping,' it could benefit from elaborating on the specific pain points associated with it (e.g., lack of real-time insights, difficulty in forecasting, etc.). It also might be helpful to mention the impact of poor financial management beyond just cash flow issues (e.g., missed growth opportunities, inability to secure funding).
**Suggestions**: Include specific examples of how manual bookkeeping hinders SMBs (e.g., difficulty in tracking expenses, generating reports, etc.). Add a brief explanation of how poor financial management impacts other areas of the business (e.g., customer acquisition, employee morale, etc.).
