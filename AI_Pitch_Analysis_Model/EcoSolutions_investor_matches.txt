Blue Collective:
Match Score: 75/100
Reasoning: While the founder's funding requirement is significantly higher than the investor's preferred range, the investor's sector-agnostic approach and willingness to consider Series+ investments make this a potential match. The $3M revenue indicates strong traction, further increasing the investor's potential interest. The investor's preference for earlier-stage companies might be a slight drawback, but the founder's solid revenue stream could outweigh that concern.
